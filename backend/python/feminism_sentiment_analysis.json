Neither the embryo nor the fetus can be aware - and, therefore, experience - pain. A woman who decides to have an abortion does not hurt anyone but herself. From 40 to 60% of the embryos are not able to develop due to genetic errors, therefore, they are subjected to \"natural\" abortion. Medical abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy is a procedure that is the “direct successor” of biological processes that are already going on in a woman’s body.",

What you’re describing is appalling, both the horrific oppression of women in Afghanistan and the vile responses you saw online. It’s heartbreaking that men like that can dehumanize women and then play the victim when called out. What he said was absolutely unacceptable, and it’s exhausting how often women are forced to defend their basic humanity.\n\nThat said, I also can’t help but think that we’re being manipulated into this division on a larger scale. Young men and boys like him don’t become hateful overnight—they’re fed this ideology by influencers and systems that profit from pitting us against each other. Meanwhile, women are rightfully angry at the violence and oppression they face, but the solutions we’re trying aren’t fully addressing the root causes of this hatred.\n\nI really hope we can work together to find a way to tackle the bigger, systemic issues like economic inequality, mental health, and the way social media is weaponized to divide us (primarily speaking from my experience as a woman in the US). Because what we’re doing now isn’t solving the problem, and we deserve better. You’re already doing so much by speaking out and I believe that together we can push for real change.",

He was baiting for a response so he could play the helpless victim/martyr and he got it. \n\n\n Many of them are desperate for any attention at all from women, even negative. Don't give them any of the precious time of your life you can never get back. Also, it makes them look stupid when they whine and cry about misandry and they receive no response at all. They can't claim misandry when the only response they get from women is radio silence \n\n\nEngaging with them is a waste of time. Even if you had provided a logical response backed by evidence, he would have responded with more trolling. When you respond with a taste of his own medicine, he gets to play victim. When you respond with pity he responds with more trolling. The only thing they deserve is nothing. \n\n\nI agree, we shouldn't stay silent. But we should direct our attention towards raising awareness and solidarity with other women, and men who are willing to humble themselves and listen. Don't waste time on combative misogynists, as they can not be converted by women. The only way they will ever start to be deradicalized is by a man that they respect slowly guiding them in the right direction without raising their defenses. They do not respect women, so any woman trying to preach at them or enlighten them is wasting her breath. Any woman insulting them back is just further entrenching them into their victim narrative ",

And in doing so they hurt every other civil rights advocacy group in the nation, have probably destroyed democracy, and blew up the entire post WW II order.  We are no longer the defenders of democracy.\n\nI think you've got to look deep into your own movement, because I think internalized misogyny is what did you in.  We in the LGBT community have a similar problem with internalized homophobia.  It can make you sabotage things when you're on the brink of success.\n\nAnd watching the majority of white women go for Trump not once, but twice, was heartbreaking.  Women had it in their power to transform our society and move us forward.  But for some messed up reason you all took us way backward in a way that I don't think I will live long enough to see us recover from.\n\nOf course, it's not just women.  A slim majority of the total population voted for this nightmare.  That's something no amount of blaming the Democrats will fix.  We were voted out by people wearing garbage bags and adult diapers over their jeans.  This wasn't a time and a place for sensible debate.\n\nThe US has a shitty people problem, but the women's movement has a Stockholm syndrome problem.  And the sooner we get these things sorted out, the better our chances of digging ourselves out of a hole the majority of white women put us in.",
